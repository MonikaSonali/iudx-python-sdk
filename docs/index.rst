Welcome to IUDX Python SDK documentation!
=========================================
Welcome to **IUDX Python SDK's** documentation. This documentation is divided into different parts. 
It is recommend that you get started with the **Quickstart Guide** and then head over to the **IUDX SDK package**.

Besides the Quickstart, there is also a detailed IPython Notebook  
(`Getting Started Notebook <https://github.com/datakaveri/iudx-python-sdk/blob/master/examples/Getting%20Started.ipynb>`_) 
that shows a simple usecase for using the IUDX Python SDK.
If youâ€™d rather dive into the internals of SDK, check out the SDK documentation. To get the source code, 
visit our `GitHub repository <https://github.com/datakaveri/iudx-python-sdk>`_.
